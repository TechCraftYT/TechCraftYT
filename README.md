## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

.
I mostly code in C# but I do like to mess around in other areas such as Home Assistant and Hackintoshing

âš¡ Fun fact: I actually started my tech career when I was 3 years old!
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic C# coding
ğŸ“« You can reach me over @ admin@thetechlobby.site
ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him, why do I even have to clarify that
